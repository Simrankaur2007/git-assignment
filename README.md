## Asignment
git-assignment is to get a hands on practice on GitHub.

# First git status output
PS C:\Users\abc\Desktop\git-assignment> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

# Second git status output
PS C:\Users\abc\Desktop\git-assignment> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

# Purpose of the following commands:
- `mkdir` : Create a new directory.
- `cd` : Change the current working directory.
- `code` : Vs code commands eg. code . to open the current project in vs code.
- `ls` : To list names of all the files and directories in the current folder.

# Why version control is important
## With version control, it is possible to
- Version control is important because it helps software teams work faster and smarter. It is especially useful for DevOps teams since it helps them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
- With version control, it is possible to track and manage changes to software code over time. It helps software teams manage changes to source code, work faster and smarter, and reduce development time and increase successful deployments. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. 

# Purpose of following Git Commands
- `git init`: The git init command creates a new Git repository. 
- `git status`: The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
- `git add`: The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
- `git commit`: git commit is used to create a snapshot of the staged changes along a timeline of a Git projects history.
- `git push`: The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
- `git log`: The git log command is Git's basic tool for exploring a repository's history.
- `git branch`: The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches.
- `git merge`: The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
- `git checkout`: The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch .
